# SAWLaserParameters

Repository of laser parametres used in the SAW projects. Not that the term "Laser parameter" here is used as in the scanControl
program: It consists of programs and output specifications to be used by the laser while it is operating. The laser parameters are
stored in the laser, and changed only for maintainance or upgrade.

The term "Laser profiles" has been in use within Welmax for the same programs and output specifications historically. This is quite confusing, as 
scanControl names the acual profile data read by the laser for "Laser profiles".

As a start to "de-confuse" the programs and output specifications are called laser parameters here.
